# Weather-Dashboard

## **Description**

The Weather Dashboard application allows the search of weather conditions for any location of the world through the use of the OpenWeather One Call API. For each location searched, the results render the temperature, humidity, UV index, as well as the wind speed. The name of the city will populate alongside the current date. The user will also be presented with a 5-Day Forecast. Every location that is searched will be added to a history list that the user can chooce from in the future if needed.
